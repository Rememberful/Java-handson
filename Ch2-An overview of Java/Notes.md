<h2><u>Introduction:</u></h2>

1. Java elements are interrelated (they work together).

<h2><u>Object-Oriented Programming</u></h2>

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming concept where programs are built using objects that represent real-world things.

An object contains:

    a. Data (variables / properties)

    b. Methods (functions / behaviors)

<h2><u>Two Programming Paradigms:</u></h2>

1. Process-Oriented Model: Program organized around code (procedures/functions). Code acts on data.

2. Object-Oriented Model: Program organized around data (objects).Data controls access to code.

<h2><u>Abstraction:</u></h2>

1. It means hiding complex details and showing only essential features.

Example: A car is treated as one object without thinking about its internal parts.

2. Helps manage complexity in real-world systems and programs.
