<h2><u>Introduction:</u></h2>

1. Java is just a programming language.

<h2><u>Java's Lineage:</u></h2>

1. Java's "Lineage" means the heritage and influences behind the Java programming language.
2. C → basic syntax (curly braces, loops, conditionals).
3. C++ → object-oriented structure (classes, methods).

<h2><u>The Birth of Modern Programming: C</u></h2>

1. C laid the foundation for today's programming.

<h2><u>C++: The Next Step</u></h2>

1. It extended C, by adding object oriented features

<h2><u>The Stage is set for Java:</u></h2>

1. The rise of the internet and the web created new requirements that lead directly to Java.

<h2><u>The creation of Java:</u></h2>

1. Java was developed at Sun Microsystems in 1991 by James Gosling and his team.
2. It was developed to solve portability problem

<h2><u>The	C#	Connection</u></h2>

1. C# is a Microsoft language for .NET that is heavily influenced by Java in syntax, design, and object-oriented concepts.

<h2><u>How	Java Impacted the Internet:</u></h2>

1. Java transformed the Internet by enabling secure, portable, and dynamic programs such as applets that could run on any platform.

<b> Note: </b> Applets are phased out now.

<h2><u>Java’s Magic: The Bytecode</u></h2>

1. Java compiler produces bytecode, not executable machine code.

2. Bytecode runs on the JVM, which is part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

3. Platform independence is achieved because only the JVM is platform-specific.

4. JVM provides security by running programs in a restricted sandbox environment.

5. Java uses Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to convert frequently used bytecode into native code for better performance.

6. Platform independent: Java byte code(.class file)

7. Platform dependent: JVM, JRE, JDK
