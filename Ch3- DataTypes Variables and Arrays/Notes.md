<h2><u>Introduction:</u></h2>

1. This chapter discussed about data types, variables and arrays.

<h2><u>Java Is a Strongly Typed Language:</u></h2>

1. Java is a strongly typed language, meaning every variable and expression has a clearly defined type.

2. The compiler strictly checks all assignments and method parameter passing for type compatibility. Java does not allow automatic type coercion between incompatible types.

<h2><u>The Primitive Types:</u></h2>

1. Java defines eight primitive (simple) data types: byte, short, int, long, char, float, double, and boolean.

2. These are grouped into four categories:
<ul>
<li>Integers: byte, short, int, long (whole numbers)
<li>Floating-point numbers: float, double (decimal numbers)
<li>Characters: char (single character symbols)
<li>Boolean: boolean (true/false values)
</ul>

3. Primitive types represent single values, not objects.

4. int is always 32 bits.

<h2><u>Integers:</u></h2>

1. Java	defines	four integer types:	byte, short, int, and long.

2. All four types:
<ul><li>Store positive and negative values </li>
<li>Are signed </li></ul>

3. Java does NOT support unsigned integer types (like C/C++ do).

4. Size (Width) Is Fixed - For Portability:

| Type    | Size    | Range             |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| `byte`  | 8 bits  | -128 to 127       |
| `short` | 16 bits | -32,768 to 32,767 |
| `int`   | 32 bits | -2³¹ to 2³¹-1     |
| `long`  | 64 bits | -2⁶³ to 2⁶³-1     |

5. 1 byte = 8 bits
